# KeyGoose
Hacked By Me Video 1 Code

##### KeyGoose is a fun implementation of a BadUSB, where a keyboard is "hacked" by wiring a microcontroller with custom firware to the inside of the keyboard. The microcontroller is designed to randomly deliver a payload (in the form of the [Desktop Goose Game](https://samperson.itch.io/desktop-goose "Desktop Goose Game")) to unsuspecting users in only 2.25 seconds.

The original KeyGoose video can be found [here](http://KeyGoose.HackedBy.Me "here").
